  title: "Cyclist"
  description: >
    Cycled over 1000 miles in 13 days in a self-supported
    cycletour from the southwestern tip to the northeastern tip
    of the UK. Camped in the yards of exceptionally kind strangers,
    averaged two packs of Haribo a day, and learned about cyclist's palsy
    when I lost feeling in my left hand.
    Never quite escaped the rain, never learned to love it.
