        My interests are broad, but united by an aim to 
        do social and environmental good. 
        In the past, this has included AI security, climate modeling, dolphin vocalization research, 
        political discourse analysis, freelance translating, low-resouce language tech,
        and data science for 
        a global security nonprofit.

        I earned master's degrees in Mathematics and Linguistics from Oxford, 
        where I studied as a Rhodes Scholar. Prior to Oxford, I earned degrees in Mathematics and German
        from the University of Alabama, with side quests into physics, psychology, and computer science. 
        I spent an academic year in Tanzania as a Boren Scholar, where I earned a fluency certificate in 
        Swahili. For more information: <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional</a> | <a href="#experience-target">fun</a>.
