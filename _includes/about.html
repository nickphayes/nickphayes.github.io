    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I build and implement computational tools for social good. At the moment, this means
        working in <b>AI Safety</b> and <b>AI for Climate</b>. In the former, 
        I seek to make models resistant to malicious manipulation 
        while ensuring their behavior is aligned with human values, drawing on ideas
        from <b>adversarial robustness</b>, <b>alignment</b>, and <b>interpretability</b> while
        advocating for <b>technical AI governance</b>. 
        In the latter, I aim to apply the most powerful technical tools of our time to one
        of the most pressing global issues of our time, with interests in 
        the <b>East African Climate Paradox</b> and <b>Energy Optimization</b>.

        I graduated from the University of Oxford with master's degrees in Mathematics and Linguistics, 
        where I studied as a Rhodes Scholar. Prior to Oxford, I earned degrees in Mathematics and German
        from the University of Alabama, with some side quests into physics, psychology, and computer science. 
        I spent an academic year in Tanzania as a Boren Scholar, where I earned a fluency certificate in 
        Swahili. For my CV: <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional</a> | <a href="#experience-target">fun</a>.
